# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis was to better understand the relationship between campaign outcomes based on their launch date and their funding goals. The campaign outcomes include the following terms: successful, failed, or canceled. Successful indicates the campaign met its funding goal at 100%. Failed means the campaign did not meet 100% of its funding goal. Canceled means the campaign was canceled. This analysis provides insight on successful, failed, and canceled based on their campaign funding amount. The campaign funding goals range from less than 1,000 to more than 50,0000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Within the analysis, I experienced difficulties with the second deliverable: Outcomes Based on Goals Table & Chart. I was not familiar with writing multiple actions within a code. The challenge lied within writing multiple criteria ranges in a single line to pull the desired variable. To work through this problem, I tried writing it multiple times using trial and error. By the the fourth time, I figured out some of the issues in the code I was facing such as issues with spaces, commas, or incorrect criteria selection. After that, I was able to copy the code across the fields, and alter the outcome status to  pull criteria from the outcomes section: successful, failed, or canceled. After that I felt more comfortable with my work.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
There was a spike in successful campaigns launched in the summer months (May, June, July). This being so, it would be well advised to launch fund raising campaigns for theaters in these summer months. November and December contain the lowest amount of successful campaigns. It would be well advised to not launch fundraising campaigns for theaters during these two months. 
 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Campaigns with an intended goal of less than 1,000 were the most successful at 75% of these type of campaigns being fully funded. Campaigns with an intended goal of 1000 to 4999 were the also successful at 72% of these campaigns being fully funded. It would be well advised to set a funding goal somewhere in this range for plays. 


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
In the chart and table for Outcomes Based on Goals, the variable "successful" is operationalized to identify only campaigns that met 100% of their intended goal or more. This could be a limiting factor as the campaigns that met 99% or less of their funding goals were not included as successful and were deemed a failure. This is limiting as the dataset looses valuable insight on campaigns that were fairly successful. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I suggest to create an additional table to show campaigns that achieved %90 of their funding goal. In this, we would need to change the outcome variable of success to mean 90% and failed would mean 89%. This could provide more data on campaigns that were very close to success.
